# Welcome to the EESSI project documentation!

!!! quote
    What if there was a way to avoid having to install a broad range of scientific software from scratch on every HPC cluster or cloud instance you use or maintain, without compromising on performance?

The **European Environment for Scientific Software Installations** (EESSI, pronounced as "easy") is a collaboration between different European partners in HPC community.

The goal of this project is to build a common stack of scientific software installations for HPC systems and beyond, including laptops,
personal workstations and cloud infrastructure.

More details about the project are available in the different subsections:

* [Project overview](overview.md)
* [Filesystem layer](filesystem_layer.md)
* [Compatibility layer](compatibility_layer.md)
* [Software layer](software_layer.md)
* [Pilot repository](pilot.md)
* [Getting access to EESSI](getting_access.md)
* [Using EESSI](using_eessi.md)
* [Software testing](software_testing.md)
* [Project partners](partners.md)

More recently (Nov 25th 2020), EESSI was also the topic of a presentation at the [International Series of Online Research Software
Events (SORSE)](https://sorse.github.io), see:
