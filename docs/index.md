    What if there was a way to avoid having to install a broad range of scientific software from scratch on every HPC cluster or cloud instance you use or maintain, without compromising on performance?

The **European Environment for Scientific Software Installations** (EESSI, pronounced as "easy") is a collaboration between different European partners in HPC community. The goal of this project is to build a common stack of scientific software installations for HPC systems and beyond, including laptops,
personal workstations and cloud infrastructure.
